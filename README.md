# S3-Macie

Mini Project that utilizes multiple AWS services. Macie will scan for PII and send an alert

The project is based on Adrian Cantrill project which can be found here: https://github.com/acantril/learn-cantrill-io-labs/blob/master/00-aws-simple-demos/aws-macie/Readme.md

I will add my own spin to this by creating this via Terraform
